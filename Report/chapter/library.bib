abstract = {Over the last decade, there has been a growing interest in the use of graphics processing units (GPUs) for non-graphics applications. From early academic proof-of-concept papers around the year 2000, the use of GPUs has now matured to a point where there are countless industrial applications. Together with the expanding use of GPUs, we have also seen a tremendous development in the programming languages and tools, and getting started programming GPUs has never been easier. However, whilst getting started with GPU programming can be simple, being able to fully utilize GPU hardware is an art that can take months or years to master. The aim of this article is to simplify this process, by giving an overview of current GPU programming strategies, profile-driven development, and an outlook to future trends. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Du2012,
abstract = {In this work, we evaluate OpenCL as a programming tool for developing performance-portable applications for GPGPU. While the Khronos group developed OpenCL with programming portability in mind, performance is not necessarily portable. OpenCL has required performance-impacting initializations that do not exist in other languages such as CUDA. Understanding these implications allows us to provide a single library with decent performance on a variety of platforms. We choose triangular solver (TRSM) and matrix multiplication (GEMM) as representative level 3 BLAS routines to implement in OpenCL. We profile TRSM to get the time distribution of the OpenCL runtime system. We then provide tuned GEMM kernels for both the NVIDIA Tesla C2050 and ATI Radeon 5870, the latest GPUs offered by both companies. We explore the benefits of using the texture cache, the performance ramifications of copying data into images, discrepancies in the OpenCL and CUDA compilers' optimizations, and other issues that affect the performance. Experimental results show that nearly 50{\%} of peak performance can be obtained in GEMM on both GPUs in OpenCL. We also show that the performance of these kernels is not highly portable. Finally, we propose the use of auto-tuning to better explore these kernels' parameter space using search harness. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We present novel algorithms for computing discrete Fourier transforms with high performance on GPUs. We present hierarchical, mixed radix FFT algorithms for both power-of-two and non-power-of-two sizes. Our hierarchical FFT algorithms efficiently exploit shared memory on GPUs using a Stockham formulation. We reduce the memory transpose overheads in hierarchical algorithms by combining the transposes into a block-based multi-FFT algorithm. For non-power-of-two sizes, we use a combination of mixed radix FFTs of small primes and Bluestein's algorithm. We use modular arithmetic in Bluestein's algorithm to improve the accuracy. We implemented our algorithms using the NVIDIA CUDA API and compared their performance with NVIDIA's CUFFT library and an optimized CPU-implementation (Intel's MKL) on a high-end quad-core CPU. On an NVIDIA GPU, we obtained performance of up to 300 GFlops, with typical performance improvements of 2-4times over CUFFT and 8-40times improvement over MKL for large sizes.},

@article{Gregg2011,
abstract = {General purpose GPU Computing (GPGPU) has taken off in the past few years, with great promises for increased desktop processing power due to the large number of fast computing cores on high-end graphics cards. Many publications have demonstrated phenomenal performance and have reported speedups as much as 1000{\&}{\#}x00D7; over code running on multi-core CPUs. Other studies have claimed that well-tuned CPU code reduces the performance gap significantly. We demonstrate that this important discussion is missing a key aspect, specifically the question of where in the system data resides, and the overhead to move the data to where it will be used, and back again if necessary. We have benchmarked a broad set of GPU kernels on a number of platforms with different GPUs and our results show that when memory transfer times are included, it can easily take between 2 to 50{\&}{\#}x00D7; longer to run a kernel than the GPU processing time alone. Therefore, it is necessary to either include memory transfer overhead when reporting GPU performance, or to explain why this is not relevant for the application in question. We suggest a taxonomy for future CPU/GPU comparisons, and we argue that this is not only germane for reporting performance, but is important to heterogeneous scheduling research in general.},

abstract = {In this work, the emphasis is on the development of strategies to realize techniques of numerical computing on the graphics chip. In particular, the focus is on the acceleration of techniques for solving sets of algebraic equations as they occur in numerical simulation. We introduce a framework for the implementation of linear algebra operators on programmable graphics processors (GPUs), thus providing the building blocks for the design of more complex numerical algorithms. In particular, we propose a stream model for arithmetic operations on vectors and matrices that exploits the intrinsic parallelism and efficient communication on modern GPUs. Besides performance gains due to improved numerical computations, graphics algorithms benefit from this model in that the transfer of computation results to the graphics processor for display is avoided. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by implementing direct solvers for sparse matrices, and by applying these solvers to multi-dimensional finite difference equations, i.e. the 2D wave equation and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.},

The method achieves high speed by efficiently utilizing the parallelism of the GPU throughout the whole algorithm. Initially, GPU-based bucketsort or quicksort splits the list into enough sublists then to be sorted in parallel using merge-sort. The algorithm is of complexity n log n, and for lists of 8 M elements and using a single Geforce 8800 GTS-512, it is 2.5 times as fast as the bitonic sort algorithms, with standard complexity of n (log n)2, which for a long time was considered to be the fastest for GPU sorting. It is 6 times faster than single CPU quicksort, and 10{\%} faster than the recent GPU-based radix sort. Finally, the algorithm is further parallelized to utilize two graphics cards, resulting in yet another 1.8 times speedup. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, we present a new algorithm, GPU-Warpsort, to perform comparison-based parallel sort on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). It mainly consists of a bitonic sort followed by a merge sort. Our algorithm achieves high performance by efficiently mapping the sorting tasks to GPU architectures. Firstly, we take advantage of the synchronous execution of threads in a warp to eliminate the barriers in bitonic sorting network. We also provide sufficient homogeneous parallel operations for all the threads within a warp to avoid branch divergence. Furthermore, we implement the merge sort efficiently by assigning each warp independent pairs of sequences to be merged and by exploiting totally coalesced global memory accesses to eliminate the bandwidth bottleneck. Our experimental results indicate that GPU-Warpsort works well on different kinds of input distributions, and it achieves up to 30{\%} higher performance than previous optimized comparison-based GPU sorting algorithm on input sequences with millions of elements.},

abstract = {Sorting a list of input numbers is one of the most fundamental problems in the field of computer science in general and high-throughput database applications in particular. Although literature abounds with various flavors of sorting algorithms, different architectures call for customized implementations to achieve faster sorting times. This paper presents an efficient implementation and detailed analysis of MergeSort on current CPU architectures. Our SIMD implementation with 128-bit SSE is 3.3X faster than the scalar version. In addition, our algorithm performs an efficient multiway merge, and is not constrained by the memory bandwidth. Our multi-threaded, SIMD implementation sorts 64 million floating point numbers in less than0.5 seconds on a commodity 4-core Intel processor. This measured performance compares favorably with all previously published results. Additionally, the paper demonstrates performance scalability of the proposed sorting algorithm with respect to certain salient architectural features of modern chip multiprocessor (CMP) architectures, including SIMD width and core-count. Based on our analytical models of various architectural configurations, we see excellent scalability of our implementation with SIMD width scaling up to 16X wider than current SSE width of 128-bits, and CMP core-count scaling well beyond 32 cores. Cycle-accurate simulation of Intel's upcoming x86 many-core Larrabee architecture confirms scalability of our proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {Solving dense linear systems of equations is a fundamental problem in scientific computing. Numerical simulations involving complex systems represented in terms of unknown variables and relations between them often lead to linear systems of equations that must be solved as fast as possible. We describe current efforts toward the development of these critical solvers in the area of dense linear algebra (DLA) for multicore with GPU accelerators. We describe how to code/develop solvers to effectively use the high computing power available in these new and emerging hybrid architectures. The approach taken is based on hybridization techniques in the context of Cholesky, LU, and QR factorizations. We use a high-level parallel programming model and leverage existing software infrastructure, e.g. optimized BLAS for CPU and GPU, and LAPACK for sequential CPU processing. Included also are architecture and algorithm-specific optimizations for standard solvers as well as mixed-precision iterative refinement solvers. The new algorithms, depending on the hardware configuration and routine parameters, can lead to orders of magnitude acceleration when compared to the same algorithms on standard multicore architectures that do not contain GPU accelerators. The newly developed DLA solvers are integrated and freely available through the MAGMA library.},

We make an extensive analysis of the performance gaps taking into account programming models, ptimization strategies, architectural details, and underlying compilers. Our results show that, for most applications, CUDA performs at most 30$\backslash${\&}{\#}x025; better than OpenCL. We also show that this difference is due to unfair comparisons: in fact, OpenCL can achieve similar performance to CUDA under a fair comparison. Therefore, we define a fair comparison of the two types of applications, providing guidelines for more potential analyses. We also investigate OpenCL's portability by running the benchmarks on other prevailing platforms with minor modifications. Overall, we conclude that OpenCL's portability does not fundamentally affect its performance, and OpenCL can be a good alternative to CUDA.},

@article{Barik2014,
abstract = {There is growing interest in usingGPUs to accelerate general- purpose computation since they offer the potential of mas- sive parallelism with reduced energy consumption. This in- terest has been encouraged by the ubiquity of integrated processors that combine a GPU and CPU on the same die, lowering the cost of offloading work to the GPU. However, while the majority of effort has focused on GPU accelera- tion of regular applications, relatively little is known about the behavior of irregular applications on GPUs. These ap- plications are expected to perform poorly on GPUs without major software engineering effort. We present a compiler framework with support for C++ features that enables GPU acceleration of a wide range of C++ applications with min- imal changes. This framework, Concord, includes a low- cost, software SVM implementation that permits seamless sharing of pointer-containing data structures between the CPU and GPU. It also includes compiler optimizations to improve irregular application performance on GPUs. Us- ing Concord, we ran nine irregular C++ programs on two computer systems containing Intel 4th Generation Core pro- cessors. One system is an Ultrabook with an integrated HD Graphics 5000 GPU, and the other system is a desktop with an integrated HD Graphics 4600 GPU. The nine appli- cations are pointer-intensive and operate on irregular data structures such as trees and graphs; they include face detec- tion, BTree, single-source shortest path, soft-body physics simulation, and breadth-first search. Our results show that Concord acceleration using the GPU improves energy effi- ciency by up to 6.04× on the Ultrabook and 3.52× on the desktop over multicore-CPU execution.},

Not only are I/O operations performed concurrently with computing, but also, in multiprocessors, several computing operations are done concurrently. A major problem in the design of such a computing system is the connecting together of the various parts of the system (the I/O devices, memories, processing units, etc.) in such a way that all the required data transfers can be accommodated. One common scheme is a high-speed bus which is time-shared by the various parts; speed of available hardware limits this scheme. Another scheme is a cross-bar switch or matrix; limiting factors here are the amount of hardware (an m × n matrix requires m × n cross-points) and the fan-in and fan-out of the hardware.},

To enhance the performance of computing systems, researchers and developers use the parallel computing architecture of GPU. On the other hand, to reduce the development time of new products, two programming models are included in GPU, which are OpenCL (Open Computing Language) and CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture). The benefit of involving the two programming models in GPU is that researchers and developers don't have to understand OpenGL, DirectX or other program design, but can use GPU through simple programming language. OpenCL is an open standard API, which has the advantage of cross-platform. CUDA is a parallel computer architecture developed by NVIDIA, which includes Runtime API and Driver API. Compared with OpenCL, CUDA is with better performance. In this paper, we used plenty of similar kernels to compare the computing performance of C, OpenCL and CUDA, the two kinds of API's on NVIDIA Quadro 4000 GPU. The experimental result showed that, the executive time of CUDA Driver API was 94.9{\%}{\~{}}99.0{\%} faster than that of C, while and the executive time of CUDA Driver API was 3.8{\%}{\~{}}5.4{\%} faster than that of OpenCL.

abstract = {Recently, OpenCL, a new open programming standard for GPGPU programming, has become available in addition toCUDA. OpenCL can support various compute devices due to its higher abstraction pro- gramming framework. Since there is a semantic gap between OpenCL and compute devices, the OpenCL C compiler plays important roles to exploit the potential of compute devices and therefore its capabil- ity should be clarified. In this paper, the performance of CUDA and OpenCL programs is quantitatively evaluated. First, several CUDA and OpenCL programs of almost the same computations are developed, and their performances are compared. Then, the main factors causing their performance differences is investigated. The evaluation results suggest that the performances of OpenCL programs are comparable with those of CUDA ones if the kernel codes are appropriately optimized by hand or by the compiler optimizations. This paper also discusses the differences between NVIDIA and AMD OpenCL implementations by comparing the performances of their GPUs for the same programs. The performance comparison shows that the compiler options of the OpenCL C compiler and the execution configuration parameters have to be optimized for each GPU to obtain its best performance. Therefore, automatic param- eter tuning is essential to enable a single OpenCL code to run efficiently on various GPUs.},

Histone methylation is dynamically regulated by histone methylases and demethylases such as LSD1 and JHDM1, which mediate demethylation of di- and monomethylated histones. It has been unclear whether demethylases exist that reverse lysine trimethylation. We show the JmjC domain-containing protein JMJD2A reversed trimethylated H3-K9/K36 to di- but not mono- or unmethylated products. Overexpression of JMJD2A but not a catalytically inactive mutant reduced H3-K9/K36 trimethylation levels in cultured cells. In contrast, RNAi depletion of the C. elegans JMJD2A homolog resulted in an increase in general H3-K9Me3 and localized H3-K36Me3 levels on meiotic chromosomes and triggered p53-dependent germline apoptosis. Additionally, other human JMJD2 subfamily members also functioned as trimethylation-specific demethylases, converting H3-K9Me3 to H3-K9Me2 and H3-K9Me1, respectively. Our finding that this family of demethylases generates different methylated states at the same lysine residue provides a mechanism for fine-tuning histone methylation.},

abstract = {CUDA and OpenCL are two different frameworks for GPU programming. OpenCL is an open standard that can be used to program CPUs, GPUs, and other devices from different vendors, while CUDA is specific to NVIDIA GPUs. Although OpenCL promises a portable language for GPU programming, its generality may entail a performance penalty. In this paper, we use complex, near-identical kernels from a Quantum Monte Carlo application to compare the performance of CUDA and OpenCL. We show that when using NVIDIA compiler tools, converting a CUDA kernel to an OpenCL kernel involves minimal modifications. Making such a kernel compile with ATI's build tools involves more modifications. Our performance tests measure and compare data transfer times to and from the GPU, kernel execution times, and end-to-end application execution times for both CUDA and OpenCL.},

@article{Christopoulos2000,
abstract = {With the increasing use of multimedia technologies, image compression requires higher performance as well as new features. To address this need in the specific area of still image encoding, a new standard is currently being developed, the JPEG2000. It is not only intended to provide rate-distortion and subjective image quality performance superior to existing standards, but also to provide features and functionalities that current standards can either not address efficiently or in many cases cannot address at all. Lossless and lossy compression, embedded lossy to lossless coding, progressive transmission by pixel accuracy and by resolution, robustness to the presence of bit-errors and region-of-interest coding, are some representative features. It is interesting to note that JPEG2000 is being designed to address the requirements of a diversity of applications, e.g. Internet, color facsimile, printing, scanning, digital photography, remote sensing, mobile applications, medical imagery, digital library and E-commerce.},
