Five different multi-core technologies are used in this study. One is a proprietary parallel computing platform and API, namely {\CU}. \textit{Compute Shaders} in {\GL} and {\DX} are parts of graphic programming languages but have a fairly general structure and allows for general computing. {\OCL} aims at any heterogeneous multi-core system and is used in this study solely on the GPU. To compare with the CPU, {\OMP} is included as a fast and easy way to parallelize sequential {\CPP} -code.

\section{CUDA}

CUDA is an acronym for Compute Unified Device Architecture, developed by NVIDIA and released in 2006. {\CU} is an extension of the {\CPP} language and have its own compiler. {\CU} supports the functionality to execute kernels, modify the graphic card RAM memory and the use of several optimized function libraries such as \textit{cuBLAS} ({\CU} implementation of BLAS, Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) or \textit{cuFFT} ({\CU} implementation of FFT).

A program running on the GPU is called a kernel. The GPU is referred to as the \textit{device} and the the CPU is called the \textit{host}. To run a {\CU} kernel all that is needed is to declare the program with a function type specifier, see table \ref{tab:cuda:func-types}, and call it from the host with launch parameters.
